# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
This Repository is a collection of multiple EDA projects:
1. Bank_Marketing : The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

2. Diabetes : This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

3. Bank Churn : Dataset:The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains
information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer.
